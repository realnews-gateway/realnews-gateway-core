# Emergency Publishing Channel

The Emergency Publishing Channel is the core of RealNews Free Publish Core. It provides a safe, anonymous, censorship‑resistant pathway for users to publish public‑interest content under hostile conditions.

## Accounts and Anonymity

- Accounts are required for system access.  
- Anonymity is also required: account identity is strictly separated from publishing identity.  
- This ensures controlled access while preserving anonymous publishing.

## Encryption Strategy

- Encryption is automatically enabled, not optional.  
- All submitted content is encrypted during transmission and storage.  
- Users do not need to take extra steps to gain encryption protection.

## Goals

- Enable eyewitness reports and civic documentation  
- Resist state‑level censorship and takedowns  
- Protect user identity and metadata  
- Ensure long‑term content availability  
- Provide multi‑mirror distribution  

## Publishing Pipeline

1. **Submission**  
   - Account login required  
   - Anonymous upload (account/identity separation)  
   - Automatic encryption  

2. **Sanitization**  
   - Metadata stripping  
   - Format normalization  
   - Hash‑based deduplication  

3. **Mirroring**  
   - Multi‑node replication  
   - Automatic fallback routing  
   - Decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave)  

4. **Distribution**  
   - NGO/media endpoints  
   - Public mirror sites  
   - Encrypted channels  

## Security Properties

- Accounts exist but anonymity preserved  
- Automatic encryption protection  
- No logs  
- Minimal client footprint  
- Transport‑layer camouflage  

## Out‑of‑Scope Threats

- Device‑level compromise  
- Physical coercion  
- OS‑level surveillance  

These threats exceed the scope of software‑level protections.
