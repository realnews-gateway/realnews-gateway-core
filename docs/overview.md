# Overview

RealNews Free Publish Core is a censorship‑resistant publishing infrastructure designed to ensure that individuals in restricted environments can safely and reliably share public‑interest information. Even under severe censorship, it provides a secure pathway for eyewitness reports, media documentation, and civic information to reach the outside world.

The system consists of four major components:

1. **Emergency Publishing Channel**  
   A secure, anonymous, censorship‑resistant pipeline for publishing sensitive content.

2. **Modern Anti‑Censorship Access Layer**  
   A unified access layer integrating six advanced protocols: Hysteria2, Reality, VLESS, Trojan, XTLS, and XHTTP.

3. **Resilient News Aggregation Module**  
   A censorship‑resistant aggregator for independent journalism and mirror sources.

4. **Lightweight Anonymous BBS**  
   A minimal, privacy‑friendly discussion board for low‑risk community interaction.

This project is designed as foundational infrastructure for information freedom, not a traditional circumvention tool. It focuses on safe publishing, resilient distribution, and long‑term sustainability under adversarial conditions.

## Difference from Traditional VPN/Proxies

- **Beginner‑friendly**: Traditional proxy services (“airports”) require complex node selection and configuration. This system provides a unified six‑protocol access layer, simplifying usage for non‑technical users.  
- **Resilience against service shutdowns**: Traditional proxy services often suffer from node shutdowns or provider exit (“runaway airports”). This system uses multi‑node mirroring and automatic routing to ensure stability.  
- **Technical advancement**: Traditional VPN/proxy services rely on outdated protocols such as **vmess**, while this system consistently maintains six advanced protocols (Hysteria2, Reality, VLESS, Trojan, XTLS, XHTTP) with stronger censorship resistance.  
- **Different focus**: Traditional VPN/proxy tools mainly solve “access.” This system’s core is “publishing”—ensuring suppressed content can be safely transmitted and persistently stored.
