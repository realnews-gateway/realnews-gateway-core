# Project Overview

RealNews Gateway is an open-source information freedom infrastructure designed to help users in highly censored regions securely access independent news, global information, and public-interest content.  
The project integrates a modern censorship-resistant access layer, a resilient news aggregation system, a lightweight anonymous discussion board, and a secure uploader for external platforms and decentralized storage.

## The Problem

Millions of users live behind national firewalls that restrict access to independent journalism and global perspectives.  
Existing tools are either:

- too technical for ordinary users  
- dependent on unstable commercial proxy services (“airports”)  
- based on outdated protocols that are easily blocked  
- or lack transparency, sustainability, and long-term reliability  

RealNews Gateway addresses these structural issues by providing a unified, user-friendly, and verifiable platform built on modern anti-censorship technologies.

## Key Features

- Integration of modern protocols: Hysteria2, Reality, VLESS, Trojan, XTLS, XHTTP  
- Beginner-friendly access layer for non-technical users  
- Resilient news aggregation and mirroring  
- Anonymous, low-risk discussion board  
- Secure uploader with metadata protection  
- Open-source, auditable, and community-driven  

RealNews Gateway is designed to be deployed by NGOs, independent media, civil society groups, and community operators to provide long-term, trustworthy access to uncensored information.
