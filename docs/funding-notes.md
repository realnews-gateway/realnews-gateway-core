# Funding Notes

RealNews Free Publish Core is structured to align with funder expectations while maintaining strong boundaries between open‑source infrastructure and closed‑source commercial components.

## Open‑Source Scope (Fundable)

The following components are fully open‑source and eligible for funding:
- Emergency Publishing Channel (core logic)
- VPN access layer integration
- News aggregation module
- Anonymous BBS
- Documentation and architecture
- Deployment tooling for NGOs and media organizations

These components are licensed under AGPLv3 to ensure public benefit and prevent commercial exploitation without contribution.

## Closed‑Source Scope (Not Funded)

The following components remain proprietary and are not part of the open‑source release:
- Commercial‑grade routing optimization
- AI‑based traffic shaping
- Enterprise‑level dashboards
- Large‑scale node orchestration
- Commercial mobile/desktop apps

These components ensure long‑term sustainability and prevent direct replication of the full product.

## Funding Philosophy

The project is designed to:
- Maximize public benefit  
- Protect critical intellectual property  
- Ensure long‑term sustainability  
- Maintain clear boundaries between open and closed components  

This structure aligns with modern digital rights funding expectations.
