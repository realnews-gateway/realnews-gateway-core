# Documentation Module

The Documentation module provides high‑level, funder‑facing and reviewer‑facing explanations of the system.  
It is designed to give non‑technical and semi‑technical audiences a clear understanding of the project’s goals, threat model, architecture, and operational model.

This module complements the Architecture and Modules directories by offering narrative explanations, conceptual overviews, and context for why the system exists and how it is intended to be used.
