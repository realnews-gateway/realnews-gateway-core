# News Aggregation Module

The news aggregation module is responsible for collecting, normalizing, deduplicating, and classifying news content from diverse sources.  
It serves as the primary ingestion layer for the RealNews publishing pipeline, feeding structured and verified content into the emergency channel, publisher, and distribution systems.

This module ensures that the system can continuously gather reliable information even under censorship, network instability, or partial source failure.

---

## Objectives

The news aggregation module provides:

- Multi-source content ingestion (RSS, APIs, scrapers, mirrors)
- Content normalization and metadata extraction
- Deduplication across heterogeneous sources
- Topic classification and clustering
- Source reliability scoring
- Region-aware source selection
- Integration with emergency publishing workflows

These capabilities ensure that the system maintains a steady flow of high-quality, censorship-resistant news content.

## Architecture Overview

The aggregation pipeline consists of four major stages:

### 1. Source Discovery
    - Maintains a registry of news sources (RSS feeds, APIs, mirrors, curated lists)
    - Supports region-specific source sets
    - Automatically rotates or replaces failing sources

### 2. Content Fetching
    - Fetches content using HTTP(S), CDN-backed endpoints, or proxy layers
    - Supports fallback transports (TLS, QUIC, HTTP/2)
    - Handles rate limits, retries, and network failures

### 3. Normalization and Parsing
    - Extracts titles, timestamps, authors, tags, and body text
    - Converts HTML to clean structured text
    - Removes tracking parameters and noise
    - Normalizes timestamps across time zones

### 4. Deduplication and Classification
    - Identifies duplicate or near-duplicate articles
    - Clusters related content
    - Assigns topic labels (politics, economy, world, tech, etc.)
    - Scores source reliability and content quality

## Directory Structure

The module is organized as follows:

    news-aggregation/
    ├── README.md              # Overview and architecture
    ├── sources.md             # Source registry and region-aware source sets
    ├── fetcher.md             # Fetching logic, retries, fallback transports
    ├── parser.md              # HTML parsing, metadata extraction, normalization
    ├── deduplication.md       # Duplicate detection and clustering
    └── classification.md      # Topic classification and source scoring

Each file documents a major subsystem of the aggregation pipeline.

## Integration with Other Modules

The news aggregation module integrates with:

- **ingest/**  
  Provides raw content for ingestion and transformation.

- **publisher/**  
  Supplies structured articles for publishing workflows.

- **emergency-channel/**  
  Feeds verified content into emergency broadcast pipelines.

- **vpn-access-layer/**  
  Ensures reliable fetching under censorship or network interference.

- **region-config/** (optional)  
  Enables region-aware source selection and fallback.

## Design Principles

The module follows these principles:

### Redundancy
    Multiple sources for each topic ensure resilience against outages.

### Normalization
    All content is converted into a consistent internal format.

### Reliability Scoring
    Sources are continuously evaluated for accuracy and stability.

### Censorship Resistance
    Fetching logic integrates with fallback transports and proxy layers.

### Minimal Metadata Leakage
    Requests avoid identifiable patterns or unnecessary headers.

## Summary

The news aggregation module provides a robust, censorship-resistant pipeline for collecting and structuring news content from diverse sources.  
By combining multi-source ingestion, normalization, deduplication, and classification, it ensures a continuous flow of high-quality information into the RealNews publishing ecosystem.
