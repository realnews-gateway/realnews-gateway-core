# Source Registry and Region-Aware Source Sets

The source registry defines all news sources used by the aggregation pipeline.  
It includes RSS feeds, APIs, curated lists, mirrors, and fallback endpoints.  
The registry is region-aware, allowing the system to adapt to censorship conditions and source availability.

This document describes how sources are organized, selected, rotated, and scored.

---

## Objectives

The source registry provides:

- A unified list of global and regional news sources
- Multiple mirrors for each source to ensure redundancy
- Region-aware source sets for censorship resistance
- Reliability scoring and automatic source rotation
- Integration with the fetcher and fallback transports

These capabilities ensure continuous content flow even under partial source failure.

---

## Source Categories

Sources are grouped into several categories:

### 1. Global News Sources
    - International news agencies
    - Major global newspapers
    - High-reliability RSS feeds
    - API-based content providers

### 2. Regional News Sources
    - Local newspapers and broadcasters
    - Region-specific RSS feeds
    - Community-curated lists
    - Local-language sources

### 3. Mirror Sources
    - CDN-backed mirrors
    - Proxy-based mirrors
    - Community-maintained mirrors
    - Archive-based fallback endpoints

### 4. High-Risk Region Sources
    - Sources frequently blocked or throttled
    - Sources requiring VPN or fallback transports
    - Sources with unstable availability

---

## Region-Aware Source Sets

The system maintains separate source sets for different regions:

### Example Regions
    - Global (default)
    - East Asia
    - Middle East
    - Europe
    - North America
    - Africa
    - High-censorship regions (CN, IR, RU)

Each region set defines:

    - Primary sources
    - Secondary sources
    - Mirrors
    - Fallback-only sources
    - Disabled sources (blocked or unstable)

The fetcher automatically selects the appropriate set based on region configuration.

## Source Metadata

Each source entry includes:

    id: Unique identifier
    url: Primary RSS/API endpoint
    mirrors: List of fallback URLs
    region: Applicable regions
    language: Primary language
    category: News category (general, politics, tech, etc.)
    reliability: Initial reliability score (0–1)
    update_interval: Expected update frequency
    requires_proxy: Whether fallback transports are required

Example:

    - id: "global_reuters"
      url: "https://www.reuters.com/rssFeed"
      mirrors:
        - "https://cdn.reuters.com/rssFeed"
        - "https://mirror.example.org/reuters"
      region: ["global", "high-censorship"]
      language: "en"
      category: "general"
      reliability: 0.95
      update_interval: 5m
      requires_proxy: false

---

## Reliability Scoring

Each source is continuously evaluated based on:

### 1. Availability
    - Success rate of fetch attempts
    - Response time
    - Mirror performance

### 2. Content Quality
    - Completeness of metadata
    - Parsing success rate
    - Duplicate ratio

### 3. Stability
    - Frequency of outages
    - Consistency of update intervals

Scores are updated dynamically and used to:

    - Prioritize high-reliability sources
    - Rotate out failing sources
    - Promote stable mirrors

---

## Source Rotation

When a source becomes unavailable:

    - The system retries with fallback transports
    - If still failing, it switches to a mirror
    - If all mirrors fail, the source is temporarily disabled
    - Disabled sources are periodically rechecked

This ensures uninterrupted content flow.

---

## Integration with Other Modules

The source registry integrates with:

- **fetcher.md**  
  Provides URLs, mirrors, and region-aware source sets.

- **parser.md**  
  Supplies metadata for parsing and normalization.

- **deduplication.md**  
  Helps identify duplicates across sources.

- **classification.md**  
  Provides category and language metadata.

- **vpn-access-layer/**  
  Enables fetching under censorship conditions.

## Summary

The source registry defines all news sources used by the aggregation pipeline, including global feeds, regional sources, and mirrors.  
By maintaining region-aware source sets, reliability scoring, and automatic rotation, the system ensures continuous and censorship-resistant content ingestion.
