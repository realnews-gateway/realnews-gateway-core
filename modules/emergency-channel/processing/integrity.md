## Integrity Module Overview

The Integrity module ensures that sanitized content has not been tampered with, corrupted, or altered during processing. It validates structural consistency, enforces deterministic transformations, and guarantees that downstream components receive content that is complete, stable, and safe to distribute.

The module does not perform semantic validation and must never infer meaning, authorship, or user identity. Its sole purpose is to ensure that the content is structurally sound and internally consistent.
