## Processing Pipeline Overview

The Processing Pipeline defines the deterministic sequence of operations applied to sanitized content. Its purpose is to classify, verify, deduplicate, enrich, and package content for safe downstream distribution. All stages operate exclusively on metadata‑free inputs and must never introduce sensitive information.

The pipeline is designed to ensure structural integrity, prevent correlation attacks, and produce standardized artifacts suitable for mirroring, NGO delivery, and archival.
