# Roadmap

This directory contains the structured development roadmap for the Emergency Publishing System.  
The roadmap is divided into three documents, each covering a different aspect of planning and execution.

## Documents

### 1. milestones.md
Defines the major milestones of the project.  
Each milestone represents a significant architectural or functional achievement.

### 2. deliverables.md
Lists the concrete outputs expected for each phase.  
These are the items that can be reviewed, tested, or deployed.

### 3. timeline.md
Provides a high-level timeline for development.  
The timeline is flexible and may adjust based on funding and collaboration.

## Purpose

The roadmap provides:

- A clear development direction  
- A structured breakdown of work  
- Transparency for collaborators and funders  
- A long-term view of system evolution  

This directory is intended to guide both technical contributors and non-technical reviewers.
