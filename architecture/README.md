# Architecture Module

The Architecture module provides a complete, system‑level description of the Emergency Publishing System.  
It explains how the core subsystem — the **Emergency Channel** — interacts with supporting modules, how data flows through the system, and how security and resilience are maintained under hostile network conditions.

This module is intended for reviewers, funders, architects, and developers who need to understand the system’s design principles and operational model.

## Contents

This directory contains the following documents:

- **system-overview.md**  
  High‑level architecture of the entire system, including the Emergency Channel and all supporting modules.

- **protocol-integration.md**  
  How multi‑protocol transports integrate with routing, sanitization, distribution, and multi‑hop delivery inside the Emergency Channel.

- **data-flow.md**  
  End‑to‑end data flow diagrams and explanations for ingestion (news‑aggregation), pseudonymous posting (anonymous‑bbs), routing, publishing, and emergency delivery.

- **security-design.md**  
  Security architecture, threat mitigation strategies, metadata minimization, and trust boundaries across all layers.

- **deployment-models.md**  
  Deployment patterns for different environments, including distributed, CDN‑backed, stealth, and multi‑region setups.

## Role of the Architecture Module

The Architecture module defines:

- The structural foundation of the Emergency Publishing System  
- How the Emergency Channel operates as the system’s core  
- How supporting modules integrate with the core  
- How data moves from ingestion to distribution  
- How the system maintains censorship resistance and operational resilience  
- How deployments can be adapted to different threat environments

This module provides the conceptual framework required to understand, evaluate, and extend the system.

## Design Principles

The architecture is guided by the following principles:

- **Resilience under censorship**  
  Multi‑protocol transports, fallback chains, and region‑aware routing.

- **Separation of concerns**  
  Access, ingestion, core processing, and distribution are clearly separated.

- **Modularity and extensibility**  
  Supporting modules evolve independently without breaking the core system.

- **Stealth and indistinguishability**  
  Traffic patterns mimic legitimate usage to evade detection.

- **Security by design**  
  Metadata minimization, encryption, and trust‑boundary isolation.

- **Operational simplicity**  
  Deployable in constrained environments with minimal configuration.

## How to Use This Module

Readers should begin with:

1. **system-overview.md**  
   to understand the overall architecture and the role of the Emergency Channel.

Then proceed to:

2. **protocol-integration.md**  
   to understand how transports integrate with routing and distribution.

3. **data-flow.md**  
   to understand ingestion, routing, and emergency delivery.

4. **security-design.md**  
   to understand threat mitigation and trust boundaries.

5. **deployment-models.md**  
   to understand real‑world deployment strategies.

## Summary

The Architecture module documents the system’s structural foundation.  
It explains how the Emergency Channel functions as the core subsystem, how supporting modules feed into it, how data moves through the system, and how security and resilience are maintained.

This module is the authoritative reference for understanding and extending the Emergency Publishing System.
