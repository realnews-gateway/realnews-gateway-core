# RealNews Gateway Core

RealNews Gateway is an open-source information freedom infrastructure designed to help users in highly censored regions securely access independent news, global information, and public-interest content.  
The project integrates an anti-censorship network access layer, a resilient news aggregation system, a lightweight anonymous discussion board, and a secure uploader to strengthen media freedom and democratic resilience.

## Mission
Access to reliable information is a prerequisite for informed decision-making and civic participation.  
RealNews Gateway aims to reduce the impact of censorship by providing a secure, resilient, and user-friendly pathway to independent news and public-interest media.

## Core Components
### **1. VPN Access Layer**
A censorship-resistant network layer built on modern transport protocols (e.g., QUIC, TLS camouflage, WebSocket fallback).  
Designed for:
- High reliability under active blocking  
- Multi-path routing  
- Automatic fallback and self-healing  

### **2. News Aggregation Module**
A resilient system that:
- Aggregates RSS and open news feeds  
- Mirrors independent media sources  
- Provides a consistent, censorship-resistant reading experience  
- Supports offline and low-bandwidth environments  

### **3. Lightweight Anonymous BBS**
A minimal, privacy-preserving discussion board enabling:
- Anonymous posting  
- Basic moderation tools  
- Low-risk community interaction  
- Optional decentralized storage for persistence  

### **4. Secure Uploader**
A safe channel for transmitting text, images, and media to:
- External platforms  
- Journalists or NGOs  
- Decentralized storage networks (IPFS, Arweave)  
With metadata protection and optional encryption.

## Why This Project Matters
Millions of users live behind information firewalls that restrict access to independent journalism and global perspectives.  
RealNews Gateway provides a modular, open-source foundation that civil society organizations, independent media, and technologists can build upon to improve information access in high-risk environments.

## Project Status
The project is in its initial development phase.  
This repository contains the open-source core architecture, documentation, and module definitions.  
Code will be released progressively as components reach stability.

## Roadmap Highlights
- News Aggregation MVP  
- VPN Access Layer integration  
- Anonymous BBS prototype  
- Secure Uploader with decentralized storage support
