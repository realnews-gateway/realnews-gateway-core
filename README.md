# RealNews Free Publish Core

## 🔥 A Censorship‑Resistant Free Publishing Infrastructure

RealNews Free Publish Core is an open-source **information freedom infrastructure** designed to empower individuals in censored environments to safely and reliably **publish** public‑interest content that would otherwise be blocked, deleted, or silenced.

At the heart of the system is a secure, censorship‑resistant **Emergency Publishing Channel** — enabling eyewitness reports, photos, videos, and civic documentation to reach the outside world even under severe censorship.

RealNews Free Publish Core is not just a circumvention tool.  
It is a **publishing infrastructure**, a **resilient media pipeline**, and a **public‑interest safeguard**.

The system integrates:

- A modern VPN access layer (Hysteria2, Reality, VLESS, Trojan, XTLS, XHTTP)  
- A censorship‑resistant Emergency Publishing Channel  
- A resilient news aggregation module  
- A lightweight anonymous discussion board  
- A secure uploader with decentralized storage (IPFS / Arweave)  

This repository contains the open-source core architecture, documentation, and module definitions for the RealNews Free Publish system.

## 🚨 Emergency Publishing Channel

The Emergency Publishing Channel is the core of the project.  
It provides a safe, anonymous, censorship‑resistant pathway for users to publish:

- Eyewitness reports  
- Photos and videos  
- Public‑interest documentation  
- Content deleted by domestic platforms  
- Information blocked by state‑level censorship  

Key features:

- Anonymous submission  
- Metadata stripping  
- Optional encryption  
- Multi-node mirroring  
- Decentralized storage (IPFS / Arweave)  
- Automatic distribution to NGOs, journalists, and independent media  

This ensures that suppressed voices can still reach the public, even under severe censorship.

## 🌐 Modern Anti‑Censorship Access Layer

RealNews Free Publish Core integrates six state‑of‑the‑art protocols:

- **Hysteria2** — QUIC-based, high-performance, resistant to active probing  
- **Reality** — TLS 1.3 camouflage with minimal fingerprint  
- **VLESS** — Flexible, modern, widely supported  
- **Trojan** — Pure TLS camouflage  
- **XTLS** — Low-fingerprint, high-performance transport  
- **XHTTP** — HTTP/3-based, indistinguishable from normal web traffic  

These protocols are unified into a single, beginner‑friendly access layer designed for non‑technical users.
