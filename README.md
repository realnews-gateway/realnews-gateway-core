# RealNews Gateway Core

RealNews Gateway is an open-source information freedom infrastructure project designed to help users in highly censored regions securely access independent news, global information, and public interest content.  
The project combines an anti-censorship network access layer, a news aggregation module, and a lightweight anonymous discussion board to support media freedom and democratic resilience.

## Core Objectives
- Provide reliable anti-blocking network access  
- Aggregate global public news sources  
- Support secure distribution of independent media content  
- Offer anonymous, low-risk interaction space for high-risk users  
- Build verifiable, auditable public-interest technology through open source  

## Project Modules
- **VPN Access Layer**: Anti-censorship network access based on open-source technology  
- **News Aggregation**: Global news source aggregation and mirroring  
- **Lightweight BBS**: Anonymous, moderated discussion board  
- **Secure Uploader**: Safely transmit content to external platforms or decentralized storage  

## Project Status
RealNews Gateway is currently in its initial setup phase, focusing on architecture and documentation.  
Code will be released progressively as development advances.
