# Emergency Channel — Sanitizer Module

## Overview

The Sanitizer module is responsible for validating, cleaning, and normalizing all incoming content before it enters the Emergency Channel pipeline.  
It acts as a critical security boundary, ensuring that untrusted inputs cannot compromise the system, leak metadata, or violate publishing policies.

The module provides a unified architecture with format‑specific sanitizers for:

- Text
- Images
- Video
- Documents

Each sanitizer follows a deterministic, multi‑stage pipeline to guarantee predictable and reproducible output.

## Goals

The Sanitizer module ensures that all incoming content is:

- Safe and free of malicious payloads  
- Stripped of sensitive metadata  
- Normalized into stable, deterministic formats  
- Compliant with system policies (size, duration, resolution, etc.)  
- Ready for routing, storage, and distribution  

It is a foundational component of the Emergency Channel’s security and reliability.

## Module Structure

This directory contains the following files:

### High‑Level Architecture

- **overview.md**  
  Describes the overall design, security goals, and role of the Sanitizer module.

- **pipeline.md**  
  Defines the unified sanitization pipeline shared across all content types.

### Format‑Specific Sanitizers

- **text.md**  
  Sanitization rules and pipeline for plain text and Markdown.

- **image.md**  
  Sanitization rules for PNG, JPEG, WebP, and other image formats.

- **video.md**  
  Sanitization rules for MP4 and other supported video containers.

- **document.md**  
  Sanitization rules for PDF, DOCX, PPTX, and other document formats.

## Deterministic Processing

All sanitizers must produce identical output for identical input:

- No randomness  
- No environment‑dependent behavior  
- No time‑dependent metadata  
- No heuristic rewriting that varies between runs  

Determinism ensures stable downstream processing and reproducible results.

---

## Security Boundary

The Sanitizer module treats all incoming content as untrusted.  
It blocks:

- Scripts, macros, and executable payloads  
- Malformed or disguised formats  
- Encrypted or password‑protected files  
- Oversized or unbounded content  
- Hidden metadata or alternate streams  

Logs are anonymized and used for threat detection and debugging.

---

## Summary

The Sanitizer module provides:

- A unified architecture for content safety  
- Deterministic, reproducible transformations  
- Format‑specific sanitization pipelines  
- Strong protection against malicious or malformed inputs  

It is a core component of the Emergency Channel’s trust and security model.
